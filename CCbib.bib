This silhouette shows which objects lie well within their cluster, and which ones are merely somewhere in between clusters. The entire clustering is displayed by combining the silhouettes into a single plot, allowing an appreciation of the relative quality of the clusters and an overview of the data configuration. The average silhouette width provides an evaluation of clustering validity, and might be used to select an `appropriate' number of clusters.},

  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods provide consistent approximations of integrals as the number of iterations goes to {$\infty$}. MCMC estimators are generally biased after any fixed number of iterations. We propose to remove this bias by using couplings of Markov chains together with a telescopic sum argument of Glynn and Rhee. The resulting unbiased estimators can be computed independently in parallel. We discuss practical couplings for popular MCMC algorithms. We establish the theoretical validity of the estimators proposed and study their efficiency relative to the underlying MCMC algorithms. Finally, we illustrate the performance and limitations of the method on toy examples, on an Ising model around its critical temperature, on a high dimensional variable-selection problem, and on an approximation of the cut distribution arising in Bayesian inference for models made of multiple modules.},

  abstract = {Communication costs, resulting from synchronization requirements during learning, can greatly slow down many parallel machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we present a parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm in which subsets of data are processed independently, with very little communication. First, we arbitrarily partition data onto multiple machines. Then, on each machine, any classical MCMC method (e.g., Gibbs sampling) may be used to draw samples from a posterior distribution given the data subset. Finally, the samples from each machine are combined to form samples from the full posterior. This embarrassingly parallel algorithm allows each machine to act independently on a subset of the data (without communication) until the final combination stage. We prove that our algorithm generates asymptotically exact samples and empirically demonstrate its ability to parallelize burn-in and sampling in several models.},

  abstract = {In unsupervised learning, the problem of finding the appropriate number of clusters -usually notated as k- is very challenging. Its importance lies in the fact that k is a vital hyperparameter for the most clustering algorithms. One algorithmic approach for tacking this problem is to apply a certain clustering algorithm with various cluster configurations and decide to use the one that maximizes a certain internal validity measure. This is a promising and computationally efficient approach since the independent runs are parallelizable. In this paper, we attempt to improve over this estimation approach by incorporating a consensus clustering approach into k estimating scheme. The weighted consensus clustering scheme employs four different indices namely Silhouette (SH), Calinski\textendash Harabasz (CH), Davies\textendash Bouldin (DB), and Consensus (CI) indices to estimate the correct number of cluster. Computational experiments in a dataset with clusters ranging from 2 to 7 show the profound advantages of weighted consensus clustering for correctly finding k in comparison to individual clustering method (e.g, k-means) and simple consensus clustering.},

We propose weighted consensus clustering, where each input clustering is weighted and the weights are determined in such a way that the final consensus clustering provides a better quality solution, in which clusters are better separated comparing to standard consensus clustering. Theoretically, we show that a reformulation of the wellknown L1 regularization LASSO problem is equivalent to the weight optimization of our weighted consensus clustering, and thus our approach provides sparse solutions which may resolve the difficult situation when the input clusterings diverge significantly. We also show that the weighted consensus clustering resolves the redundancy problem when many input clusterings correlate highly. Detailed algorithms are given. Experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the weighted consensus clustering.},

  author = {Strehl, Alexander and Ghosh, Joydeep},
  abstract = {This paper introduces the problem of combining multiple partitionings of a set of objects into a single consolidated clustering without accessing the features or algorithms that determined these partitionings. We first identify several application scenarios for the resultant `knowledge reuse' framework that we call cluster ensembles. The cluster ensemble problem is then formalized as a combinatorial optimization problem in terms of shared mutual information. In addition to a direct maximization approach, we propose three effective and efficient techniques for obtaining high-quality combiners (consensus functions). The first combiner induces a similarity measure from the partitionings and then reclusters the objects. The second combiner is based on hypergraph partitioning. The third one collapses groups of clusters into meta-clusters which then compete for each object to determine the combined clustering. Due to the low computational costs of our techniques, it is quite feasible to use a supra-consensus function that evaluates all three approaches against the objective function and picks the best solution for a given situation. We evaluate the effectiveness of cluster ensembles in three qualitatively different application scenarios: (i) where the original clusters were formed based on non-identical sets of features, (ii) where the original clustering algorithms worked on non-identical sets of objects, and (iii) where a common data-set is used and the main purpose of combining multiple clusterings is to improve the quality and robustness of the solution. Promising results are obtained in all three situations for synthetic as well as real data-sets.},

As opposed to popular algorithms such as agglomerative hierarchical clustering or k-means which return a single clustering solution, Bayesian nonparametric models provide a posterior over the entire space of partitions, allowing one to assess statistical properties, such as uncertainty on the number of clusters. However, an important problem is how to summarize the posterior; the huge dimension of partition space and difficulties in visualizing it add to this problem. In a Bayesian analysis, the posterior of a real-valued parameter of interest is often summarized by reporting a point estimate such as the posterior mean along with 95\% credible intervals to characterize uncertainty. In this paper, we extend these ideas to develop appropriate point estimates and credible sets to summarize the posterior of the clustering structure based on decision and information theoretic techniques.},

In the evidence accumulation clustering (EAC) paradigm, the clustering ensemble is transformed into a pairwise co-association matrix, thus avoiding the label correspondence problem, which is intrinsic to other clustering ensemble schemes. In this paper, we propose a consensus clustering approach based on the EAC paradigm, which is not limited to crisp partitions and fully exploits the nature of the co-association matrix. Our solution determines probabilistic assignments of data points to clusters by minimizing a Bregman divergence between the observed co-association frequencies and the corresponding co-occurrence probabilities expressed as functions of the unknown assignments. We additionally propose an optimization algorithm to find a solution under any double-convex Bregman divergence. Experiments on both synthetic and real benchmark data show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Our approach is a stochastic search based on a series of greedy optimizations performed in a random order and is embarrassingly parallel. We consider several loss functions, including Binder loss and variation of information. We note that criticisms of Binder loss are the result of using equal penalties of misclassification and we show an efficient means to compute Binder loss with potentially unequal penalties. Furthermore, we extend the original variation of information to allow for unequal penalties and show no increased computational costs. We provide a reference implementation of our algorithm. Using a variety of examples, we show that our method produces clustering estimates that better minimize the expected loss and are obtained faster than existing methods.},

  abstract = {A random process called the Dirichlet process whose sample functions are almost surely probability measures has been proposed by Ferguson as an approach to analyzing nonparametric problems from a Bayesian viewpoint. An important result obtained by Ferguson in this approach is that if observations are made on a random variable whose distribution is a random sample function of a Dirichlet process, then the conditional distribution of the random measure can be easily calculated, and is again a Dirichlet process. This paper extends Ferguson's result to cases where the random measure is a mixing distribution for a parameter which determines the distribution from which observations are made. The conditional distribution of the random measure, given the observations, is no longer that of a simple Dirichlet process, but can be described as being a mixture of Dirichlet processes. This paper gives a formal definition for these mixtures and develops several theorems about their properties, the most important of which is a closure property for such mixtures. Formulas for computing the conditional distribution are derived and applications to problems in bio-assay, discrimination, regression, and mixing distributions are given.},
