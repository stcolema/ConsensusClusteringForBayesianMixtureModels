\section{Definitions}
\begin{definition}[Consensus matrix]
	Given $S$ clusterings for a dataset of $N$ items, $c_s=(c_{s1}, \ldots, c_{sN})$, the \emph{Consensus matrix} is a $N \times N$ matrix where the $(i, j )^{th}$ entry records the proportions of clusterings for which items $i$ and $j$ are allocated the same label. More formally, it is the matrix $\mathbb{C}$ such that
	\begin{align}
		\mathbb{C}(i, j) = \frac{1}{S} \sum_{s=1}^S \mathbf{I}(c_{si} = c_{sj})
	\end{align}
	where $\mathbb{I}(\cdot)$ is the indicator function taking a value of 1 if the argument is true and 0 otherwise.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Posterior similarity matrix]
	A \emph{Consensus matrix} for which all the clusterings are generated from a converged Markov chain for some Bayesian clustering model. Sometimes abbreviated to \emph{PSM}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Partition \emph{or} Clustering]
	For a dataset of items $X=(x_1, \ldots, x_N)$, a \emph{partition} or \emph{clustering} is a set of disjoint sets covering $X$, normally indicated by a $N$-vector of integers indicating which set each item is associated with. Note that these labels only have meaning relative to each other, they are symbolic. Each set within the clustering is referred to as a \emph{cluster}.
\end{definition}

\section{The models} \label{sec:models}

\subsection{Individual dataset}
In the simulations (see section \ref{sec:simulations}) where individual datasets are modelled a \emph{Bayesian mixture model} is used. We write the basic mixture model for independent items $X=(x_1, \ldots, x_N)$ as 
\begin{align}
	x_n \sim \sum_{k=1}^K\pi_k f(x_n | \theta_k) \hspace{1cm} \textrm{independently for $n = 1,\ldots,N$}
\end{align}
where $f(\cdot| \theta)$ is some family of densities parametrised by $\theta$. A common choice is the Gaussian density function, with $\theta=(\mu, \sigma^2)$ (as in our simulation study). $K$, the number of subgroups in the population, $\{\theta_k\}_{k=1}^K$, the component parameters, and $\pi=(\pi_1, \ldots, \pi_K)$, the component weights are the objects to be inferred. In the context of \emph{clustering}, such a model arises due to the belief that the population from which the random sample under analysis has been drawn consists of $K$ unknown groups proportional to $\pi$. In this setting it is natural to include a latent \emph{allocation variable}, $c=(c_1, \ldots, c_N)$, to indicate which group each item is drawn from, with each non-empty component of the mixture corresponds to a cluster. The model is
\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:mixModel}
	\begin{array}{r@{}l l}
		p(c_n = k) = \pi_k&  &\textrm{for $k = 1,\ldots,K$,} \\
		x_n | c_n \sim f(x_n | \theta_k)& &\textrm{independently for $n = 1,\ldots,N$.} 
	\end{array}
\end{equation}
The joint model can then be written
\begin{align}
	p(X, c, K, \pi, \theta) &= p(X | c, \pi, K, \theta) p(\theta | c, \pi, K) p(c | \pi, K) p(\pi | K) p(K) \nonumber
\end{align}
%An assumption that is frequently used is that the density of each feature is independent, with $\theta_k=(\theta_{k1},\ldots, \theta_{kP})$ for all $k=1,\ldots,K$. Furthermore,
We assume conditional independence between certain parameters such that the model reduces to
\begin{align}
	p(X, c, \theta, \pi, K) &=  p(\pi | K) p(\theta | K) p(K) \prod_{n=1}^N p(x_n | c_n, \theta_{c_n}) p (c_n | \pi, K).  \label{eqn:jointMixModel}
	%	\\
	%	&= \prod_{i=1}^N \prod_{p=1}^P p(x_{ip} | c_i, \theta_{c_ip})^{(1 - \phi_p)} p(x_{ip} | \theta_p) ^ {\phi_p} \times \\
	%	& \prod_{i=1}^N p (c_i | \pi, K) p(\pi | K) p(\theta | K)
\end{align}
Additional flexibility is provided by the inclusion of hyperparameters on the priors for $\pi$ and $\theta$, denoted $\alpha$ and $\eta$ respectively. In our context where $\theta=(\mu, \sigma^2)$, we use
\begin{align}
	\sigma^2 &\sim \Gamma^{-1}(a, b), \\
	\mu &\sim \mathcal{N}(\xi, \frac{1}{\lambda} \sigma^2), \\
	\pi &\sim \textrm{Dirichlet}(\alpha).
\end{align}
The directed acyclic graph (\textbf{DAG}) for this model is shown in figure \ref{fig:simpleMixNormalsDAG}. The value of the hyperparameters we use are
\begin{align}
	\alpha &= 1, \\
	\xi &= 0.0, \\
	\lambda &= 1.0,\\
	a &= 2.0,\\
	b &= 2.0.
\end{align}

\subsection{Integrative clustering}
We are interested in the use of Consensus clustering for integrative methods. We used Multiple Dataset Integration \citep[\textbf{MDI}, ][]{kirk2012bayesian} as an example of a Bayesian integrative clustering method. MDI models dataset specific clusterings, in contrast to, for example, Clusternomics \citep{gabasova2017clusternomics} in which a \emph{global clustering} is inferred.

%We use the implementation made by \citep{mason2016mdi} which produces MCMC samples of the allocation vector and is thus suited to our construction of Consensus clustering.

%Bayesian mixture models have been extended to the multiple dataset context where they are used to perform integrative clustering. This means that as much pertinent information as possible can be included in the joint model. Multiple Dataset Integration \citep[\textbf{MDI}, ][]{kirk2012bayesian} is an example of such a model where dataset specific clusterings are learnt, informed by common information. We use MDI to model the clustering structure of the Yeast datasets in section \ref{sec:yeast}. The modelling of the shared information is described by the prior distribution on item allocation for $L$ datasets
The defining aspect of MDI is the prior on the allocation of the $n^{th}$ item across the $L$ datasets
\begin{align}
	p(c_{n1}, \ldots, c_{nL}) \propto \prod_{l=1}^L \pi_{c_{nl}l}\prod_{l=1}^{L-1}\prod_{m=l+1}^L(1 + \phi_{lm} \mathbb{I}(c_{nl} = c_{nm})) \textrm{ for $n = 1,\ldots,N$.}
	\label{eqn:mdiPrior}
\end{align}
$\phi_{lm}$ is the parameter defined by the similarity of the clusterings for the $l^{th}$ and $m^{th}$ datasets and is also sampled in each iteration. As $\phi_{lm}$ increases more mass is placed on the common partition for these datasets. Conversely, in the limit $\phi_{lm}\to 0$ we have independent mixture models. In other words, MDI allows datasets with similar clustering of the items to inform the clustering in each other more strongly than the clustering for an unrelated dataset. The DAG for this model for three datasets is shown in figure \ref{fig:MDIDAG}.

\section{Consensus clustering}
Consensus clustering is an ensemble approach to cluster analysis. Ensembles are often better able to explore the full parameter space than any individual learner in its composition, thus describing more modes within parameters than the individual learners \citep{ghaemi2011review}. Ensembles also offer reductions in computational runtime because most ensemble methods enable use of a parallel environment to improve computation speed \citep{ghaemi2009survey}. 

Consensus clustering \citep{monti2003consensus} is an ensemble method for cluster analysis, previously implemented using $k$-means clustering as the base learner in the R package \texttt{ConsensusClusterPlus} \citep{wilkerson2010consensusclusterplus}. Consensus clustering has been applied in a variety of biomedical setting such as cancer subtyping \citep{lehmann2011identification, verhaak2010integrated}, identifying subclones in single cell analysis \citep{kiselev2017sc3}, and proteomic characterisation of tumours \citep{xu2020integrative}. Consensus clustering applies $S$ independent runs of the underlying clustering algorithm to peturbed versions of the dataset and combines the $S$ final partitions in a \emph{Consensus matrix} which is used to infer a final clustering. An outline of this is described in algorithm \ref{algorithm:CC}. 

The consensus matrix is a symmetric matrix with the $(i, j)^{th}$ entry being the proportions of model runs for which the $i^{th}$ and $j^{th}$ items are clustered together. For a single partition the \emph{coclustering matrix} represents this information, being a binary matrix with the $(i, j)^{th}$ entry indicating if items $i$ and $j$ are allocated to the same cluster.

%\subsubsection{Consensus clustering of Bayesian mixture models}
Ensemble methods are rarely applied Bayesian models despite \cite{monti2003consensus} suggesting this. We believe that Bayesian methods are underexploited in the ensemble framework and propose applying Consensus clustering to Bayesian mixture models. Our implementation of this is described in algorithm \ref{algorithm:CCforBayesianMixtures}.

		$\hat{Y} \leftarrow$ partition $X$ based upon $\mathbf{M}$\;
	}
	\caption{Consensus clustering for Bayesian mixture models}
\end{algorithm}
We show via simulation that ensembles consisting of short chains are sufficient to uncover meaningful structure in a number of scenarios including some within which a Gibbs sampler becomes trapped in individual modes for any reasonable length of runtime. The chains are both short and independent, thus their individual runtime is far shorter than the chains traditionally used for Bayesian inference and may also be run in parallel. This means that Consensus clustering of Bayesian mixture models offers significant reductions in runtime without sacrifices in performance. As the ensemble can describe multiple modes, the uncertainty present in the consensus matrix can be more representative of the data than the individual modes captured by any single chain.

We then considered the multiple dataset setting. We applied Consensus clustering to an integrative extension of Bayesian mixture models, Multiple Dataset Integration (MDI). We applied this ensemble to three 'omics datasets for \emph{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} and uncovered clusters that have a biological interpretation. We then compared this result to performing Bayesian inference of MDI.

%We show on three datasets from the original MDI paper that Consensus clustering performs similarly to Bayesian inference of this model, and then using more modern, larger data that Consensus clustering enables implementation of such models in scenarios where the problem of long runtimes and poor mixing previously discouraged this. 

\subsection{Stopping rule for ensemble growth} \label{sec:stopping}
As our ensemble sidesteps the problem of convergence within each chain, we need an alternative stopping rule for growing the ensemble in chain depth, $R$, and number of chains, $S$. We propose a heuristic based upon the Consensus matrix to decide if a given value of $R$ and $S$ are sufficient. We suspect that increasing $S$ and $R$ might continuously improve the performance of the ensemble, but we believe that these improvements will become smaller and smaller for greater values, approaching some asymptote for each of $S$ and $R$. Following this logic if the Consensus matrices for three ensembles define by the parameters $(aR, S), (R, bS)$ and $(R, S)$ are not visibly different for some reasonable values of $a, b, S$ and $R$ than increasing ensemble size or depth will see at most marginal improvement in performance. We suggest bounds of $a, b \in (0, 0.5]$ and $R \geq 100, S \geq 50$, but make the general observation that large $S$ and $R$ are always better and that the closer $a$ and $b$ are to 0 the more strict the stopping criteria become.

%This inspires our belief that the ensemble depth and width should be grown until this limiting behaviours emerge. In practice where no ground truth is available to compare the ARI values, we recommend visually inspecting the Consensus matrices in a grid like figures \ref{fig:simCMsIrr100}, \ref{fig:simNoStructCMs} and \ref{fig:simSmallNLargePCMs} and checking if there is any noticeable difference between the Consensus matrices for some sets of chain depth, $R'=\{r_1, \ldots, r_a\}$, and chain length $S'=\{s_1, \ldots, s_b\}$ (where $r_i < r_j \iff i < j$ and $s_i < s_j \iff i < j$ for all $i, j$). If there is no difference between the Consensus matrix for $(r_i, s_j)$ and that for $(r_a, s_b)$ for any $i = 1, \ldots, a - 1$, $j = 1, \ldots, b - 1$ than the limiting behaviour is assumed to have emerged. For example, in figure \ref{fig:simSmallNLargePCMs} this limiting behaviour appears to have emerged by $R=10$ and $S=10$, but this can only be seen by comparing the ensembles of $R = 10, S = 30$ and $R=100, S = 10$ with $R= 100, S= 30$. We suggest that $\frac{r_a}{r_{a - 1}} \leq 0.5, \frac{s_b}{s_{b-1}} \leq 0.5$ and $r_a, s_b \geq 50$.

This heuristic is partially inspired by the belief that a clustering method should produce stable results across similar datasets \citep{von2005towards, meinshausen2010stability}. We believe that if the method is still producing a partition that is visibly changing for additional chains and depth, than the random initialisation is influencing the result sufficiently that it is unlikely to be stable for similar datasets or reproducible for a random choice of seeds. % given that is the method is not stable even within the same dataset.


\section{Simulations} \label{sec:simulations}
We defined a number of scenarios to test certain concepts of the method and to explore behaviour due to specific characteristics of real data. The parameters associated with each scenario in table \ref{table:scenarioTable} were used to generate individual simulations using algorithm \ref{algorithm:simulationGeneration}. We compared Consensus clustering of Bayesian mixture models, a Bayesian inference of these models and \texttt{Mclust}, an implementation of mixture models that uses the maximum-likelihood estimator and an initialisation based upon hierarchical clustering.

	\item \emph{2D}: a low dimensional scenario within which we expected \texttt{Mclust} to perform well and the long chains to converge and explore the full support of the posterior distribution.
	\item \emph{No structure}: we included this scenario to reassure fears that Consensus clustering has a predilection to finding clusters where none exist \citep{senbabaoglu2014reassessment,senbabaouglu2014critical}.
	\item \emph{Base case}: highly informative datasets within which we expected methods to find the true generating labels quite easily. We included this scenario to benchmark the others that are variations of this setting.
	\item \emph{Large standard deviation}: these two scenarios investigated the degree of distinction required between clusters for the methods to uncover their structure.
	\item \emph{Irrelevant features}: we included these scenarios to investigate how robust the methods are to irrelevant features.
	\item \emph{Varying proportions}: these scenarios investigated how well each method uncovers clusters when the clusters have significantly different membership counts.
	\item \emph{Small $N$, large $P$}: an investigation of behaviour when the number of features is far greater than the number of items.

\subsection{Bayesian analysis} \label{sec:simBayesianAnalysis}
For each simulation we ran 10 chains for 1 million iterations, keeping every thousandth sample. We discarded the first 10,000 iterations to account for burn-in bias, leaving 990 samples per chain. To check if the chains were converged we used
\begin{itemize}
	\item the Geweke convergence diagnostic \citep{geweke1991evaluating} to investigate within-chain stationarity, and
	\item the potential scale reduction factor \citep[$\hat{R}$, ][]{gelman1992inference} and the Vats-Knudson extension \citep[\emph{stable $\hat{R}$},][]{vats2018revisiting} to check across-chain convergence.
\end{itemize}
The Geweke convergence diagnostic is a standard Z-score; it compares the sample mean of two sets of samples (in this case buckets of samples from the first half of the samples to the sample mean of the entire second half of samples). It is calculated under the assumption that the two parts of the chain are asymptotically independent and if this assumption holds (i.e. the chain is sampling the same distribution in both samples) than the scores are expected to be standard normally distributed. If a chain's Geweke convergence diagnostic passed a Shapiro-Wilks test for normality \citep{shapiro1965analysis} (based upon a threshold of 0.05), we considered it to have achieved stationarity and included it in the model performance analysis. 

$\hat{R}$ is expected to approach 1.0 if the set of chains are converged. Low $\hat{R}$ is not sufficient in itself to claim chain convergence, but values above 1.1 are clear evidence for a lack of convergence \citep{gelman2013bayesian}. \cite{vats2018revisiting} show that this threshold is significantly too high (1.01 being a better choice) and propose extensions to $\hat{R}$ that enable a more formal rule for a threshold. We use their method as implemented in the R package \texttt{stableGR} \citep{knudson20202stableGR} as the final check of convergence. An example of the $\hat{R}$ series across the 100 simulations for a scenario where chains are well-behaved is shown in figure \ref{fig:simBaseCaseRhat}.

\begin{figure} %[!tpb]

	\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{./Images/Simulations/Convergence/base_caseConvergenceAcrossChains.png}
	\caption{The $\hat{R}$ values for each simulation (in dotted grey), the median value and the interquartile range across simulations. One can see that $\hat{R}$ approaches 1.0, being below 1.01 for every simulation by the end of the chains. The ``0\% of simulations failed to converge" is a statement based upon the percentage of simulations which passed the test of stable $\hat{R}$.}
	\label{fig:simBaseCaseRhat}
\end{figure}

We focused upon stationarity of the continuous variables as assesing convergence of the allocation labels is difficult due to label-switching. In our simulations the only recorded continuous variable is the concentration parameter of the Dirichlet distribution for the component weights. 

We pooled the samples from the stationary chains and used these to form a PSM. This and the point estimate clustering found by applying the R function \texttt{maxpear} \citep{fritsch2012mcclust} to this PSM are used in model performance analysis in section \ref{sec:simModelPerformance}. \texttt{maxpear} attempts to find the clustering that maximises the Adjusted Rand Index to the true clustering by using an approximation of the expected clustering under the posterior, $\mathbb{E}(c|X)$, believing that this converges to the true clustering. A sample average clustering is used to approximate the expected clustering. This is estimated from the PSM by maximising
\begin{align}
	\frac{\sum_{i < j}\mathbb{I}(c_i^* = c_j^*) p_{ij} - \sum_{i < j}\mathbb{I}(c_i^* = c_j^*)\sum_{i < j}p_{ij} / {N \choose 2}}{\frac{1}{2}\left[\sum_{i < j}\mathbb{I}(c_i^* = c_j^*) + \sum_{i < j}p_{ij}\right] - \sum_{i < j}\mathbb{I}(c_i^* = c_j^*)\sum_{i < j}p_{ij} / {N \choose 2}}
\end{align}
where $p_{ij}$ is the $(i,j)^{th}$ entry of the PSM \citep{fritsch2009improved}. When the chain has converged this maximises the posterior expected ARI to the true clustering.

There are three possibilities to consider the decision to pool the samples across chains under:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The chains are converged and agree upon the distribution sampled (see figure \ref{fig:simPSMsAgreeExample} for an example).
	\item The chains are not in agreement upon the partition sampled, becoming trapped in different modes. However, a mode does dominate being the mode present in a majority of chains (see figure \ref{fig:simPSMsDisagreeExample} for an example of this behaviour).
	\item The chains are not in agreement and no one mode dominates among chains (see figure \ref{fig:simPSMsPathologicalDisagreeExample} for an example of this behaviour).
\end{itemize}
In the first case pooling has no effect upon the predicted clustering compared to using any one chain. In the second case it feels natural that one would use the mode that dominates. Pooling the samples effectively does this for the predictive performance of the method as the mode with the greatest number of samples across the chains dominates; however, the uncertainty for this mode is increased. In the third case the analysis is non-trivial and further thought, chains and samples would be required. In our simulations this case only arises in the most pathological form in the second \emph{Large $N$, small $P$} scenario, where each chain remains trapped in the initial partition. The clustering inferred from any chain is not meaningful being a random clustering; thus the clustering predicted by pooling the PSMs is no more or less relevant as it too is random. 
%However, the lessening of the certainty around any specific random partition is rewarded under the Frobenius norm.

\subsection{Consensus clustering analysis} 
We investigated a range of ensembles, using all combinations of chain depth, $R=(1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000)$, and the number of chains, $S=(1, 10, 30, 50, 100)$. This gave a total of 25 different ensembles. A Consensus matrix was constructed from the samples generated by each ensemble by finding the proportion of samples within which any pair of items are coclustered. An example of the Consensus matrices for each ensemble in a given simulation is shown in figure \ref{fig:simCMsIrr100}. We used the \texttt{maxpear} function from the R package \texttt{mcclust} to create a point clustering estimate from the Consensus matrix. In this context where we do not assume that the Consensus matrix of the samples is the Posterior similarity matrix we do not expect that the predicted clustering maximises the posterior expected ARI. Instead \texttt{maxpear} is used as calculating a sample average clustering which we believe is representative of the ensemble.

	\label{fig:simCMsIrr100}
\end{figure}


\subsection{\texttt{Mclust}}
We called \texttt{Mclust} using the default settings and a range of inputs for the choice of $K$. We used $K = (2, \ldots, \min(\frac{N}{2}, 50))$ to mirror the choice of $K_{max}=50$ used for the overfitted mixture models (the default in the software we used), with the bound of $\frac{N}{2}$ to avoid fitting 50 clusters in the \emph{Small $N$, large $P$} scenario where $N=50=K_{max}$. In the \emph{No structure} scenarios we extended to range to $K = (1 \ldots, 50)$ to include the correct structure as an option. The model choice was performed using the Bayesian Information Criterion \citep[][as implemented in \texttt{Mclust}]{schwarz1978estimating}. \texttt{Mclust} tries different covariance matrices and thus the model choice is not just between different values of $K$.

% An example of each scenario may be seen in figure \ref{fig:genData}

\subsection{Model performance} \label{sec:simModelPerformance}
The different models (Bayesian (pooled), \texttt{Mclust} and the 25 Consensus clustering ensembles) were compared under their ability to predict the generating clustering and their uncertainty about this quantity.

In figure \ref{fig:simPrediction} the ARI between the generating labels and the point estimate clustering from each method is shown. For two partitions $c_1, c_2$, 
\begin{itemize}
	\item $ARI(c_1, c_2) = 1.0$: a perfect match between the two partitions,
	\item $ARI(c_1, c_2) = 0.0$: $c_1$ is no more similar to $c_2$ than is expected for a random partition of the data.
\end{itemize}
In several scenarios \texttt{Mclust} performs the best under this metric (e.g. in the scenarios \emph{2D}, \emph{Small $N$, large $P$ ($\Delta \mu = 0.2$)}). However when the number of irrelevant features is large \texttt{Mclust} performs less well (see \emph{Irrelevant features ($P_n = 20$)} and \emph{($P_n = 100$)}) than the other methods. In the scenario that $P_n = 100$ failing to find structure is not inherently wrong as a majority of the features suggest that there are no subpopulations. We suspect that the initialisation based upon hierarchical clustering initialises the model in or very near to a small local mode in the likelihood surface and thus higher values of $K$ are rejected as under the BIC as the model fit is not significantly improved and the model complexity is higher. 
%The decrease in uncertainty due to conditioning on a given number of clusters, $K$, means that when \texttt{Mclust} is correct it is more certain than it might otherwise be. Secondly, 
%The initialisation used by \texttt{Mclust} is based upon a hierarchical clustering of the data. We suspect that this contributes to the better performance in the \emph{Small $N$, large $P$ ($\Delta \mu = 0.2$)} case and the poor performance in the presence of large numbers of irrelevant features.

The pooled Bayesian samples act as an upper bound on the Consensus clustering ensembles in these simulations.

For the ensembles there are two parameters changing between each model, the iteration used to provide the clustering in the ensemble, $R$, and the number of chains (and hence samples) used, $S$. In many of the scenarios we find that the benefit of increasing $R$ stabilises by approximately $R = 10$. We believe that in a low-dimensional dataset (such as \emph{2D}), or a highly informative dataset (such as \emph{Base case} or any of the higher dimensional scenarios with no irrelevant features where $\frac{\Delta \mu}{\sigma^2} \geq 1$) the chains quickly find a ``sensible" partition of the data and thus increasing the depth within the chain does not increase the probability that any partition sampled will be closer to the generating partition. For example in figure \ref{fig:simPrediction} in the \emph{Small $N$, large $P$} case, the distribution of the ARI across the ensembles for which $R\geq10$ and $S=1$ is nearly identical; this suggests that the chain is sampling a very similar partition again and again for 9,990 iterations (and possibly beyond based upon the PSMs shown in figure \ref{fig:simPSMsDisagreeExample}) and it is through adding more chains rather than using particularly long chains that we improve the ability to uncover the generating structure. 

We also notice that even if the behaviour has not stabilised for $R$ that the ensemble can uncover meaningful structure. The ARI for the ensembles of short chains can be quite high (as is the case in many of the scenarios). The behaviour of the Consensus matrices also shows that low $R$ is not a disqualifier from meaningful inference even if longer chains would be ideal, a result that might be useful in real applications with large datasets and complex models. Consider the Consensus matrices in figure \ref{fig:simCMsIrr100}, it can be seen that the behaviour has not stabilised before $R=10000$ (and possibly there is still some benefit in increasing $R$ beyond this value), but the structure being uncovered when there is a sufficient number of chains and $R$ is small does correspond to the structure uncovered in the largest and deepest ensemble. We believe that the order in which components merge and items are co-clustered varies depending on initialisation, and thus if the chain is not sufficiently deep that all of the final mergings have occured that a sufficiently large ensemble can still perform meaningful inference of the subpopulation structure despite the poor performance of any individual model. Even though each learner probably has too many clusters for small $R$ the consensus among them will have less if the individual learners have low correlation between their partitions (something we might expect if the chains are stopped very early). This is why the entries of the Consensus matrix for $R=100$ and $S=100$ in figure \ref{fig:simCMsIrr100} are more pale than in deeper ensembles; very few items correctly (possibly none) cocluster in every partition, it is only in observing the consensus that the global structure of interest emerges. Thus if there is some limit to the length of chains available for an analysis (e.g. computational or temporal constraints) than the inference obtained from the shorter chains can still be meaningful, with the caveat that the point clustering might have more clusters than the same analysis with longer chains would provide. Additional post-hoc merging of some clusters might be necessary in this case.

In contrast, when the dataset is sparse or contains many irrelevant features, we believe that deeper chains are required to reach this steady-state sampling where no single sample is expected to be better than any other (see the \emph{Irrelevant features ($P_n = 100$)} facet of figure \ref{fig:simPrediction}).
%think that in the scenarios with less distinct clusters (i.e. where the number of irrelevant features, $P_n$, is large or $\frac{\Delta \mu}{\sigma^2} \leq 1$), 


In some scenarios no method is successful in uncovering the generating labels. In the \emph{Large standard deviation ($\sigma^2 =25$)} and \emph{Small $N$, large $P$ ($\Delta \mu = 0.2$)} this is due to the lack of signal - the clusters overlap so significantly that it is not possible for any of these methods to uncover much of the generating structure. In the \emph{No structure} case it is different (although \texttt{Mclust} does perform well here). In this case all items are generated from a common distributions. For the Bayesian chains and the ensembles, a clustering of singletons is predicted; each item is allocated a unique label (see figures \ref{fig:simNoStructPSMs} and \ref{fig:simNoStructCMs}). While failing to perform well under the ARI, this is a sensible result. Rather than indicating (as we did with the shared label) that no item is particularly distinct from the others and thus all share a common label, this clustering of singletons states that no item is more similar to any other and thus no two items should cluster together. It is an alternative statement of the same result, i.e. that there is no evidence for subpopulation structure. We consider this evidence that an ensemble of Bayesian mixture models is not as susceptible to predicting labels than an ensemble based upon $K$-means clustering as in \cite{senbabaoglu2014reassessment,senbabaouglu2014critical}.

	\label{fig:simNoStructCMs}
\end{figure}

Increasing $S$ is also required when the dimensionality of the dataset is large. In this case it is due to individual chains exploring only a single mode (as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:simPSMsDisagreeExample} where each chain appears to sample only a single partition). In this example where each sample is a partition that appears to be a mode in the posterior distribution of the allocation vector from very early in the chain (based upon the stable performance for $R \geq 10$), increasing $S$ allows each chain to ``vote" on which mode is the global mode, as we believe that the mode that attracts the most chains is the global mode (although in real datasets the number of chains required might be greater than in our simulations). An example of this behaviour may be seen in figure \ref{fig:simSmallNLargePCMs}.

\begin{figure} %[!tpb]

	\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{./Images/Simulations/CMs/small_n_large_p_baseSim1.png}
	\caption{Consensus matrices for simulation 1 of the first \emph{Large $N$, small $P$} scenario. One can see that by iteration ten the sample being drawn is from the mode (for $S=1$, $R = 10$), and that an ensemble of chains does find structure that recalls the generating labels (see figure \ref{fig:simPrediction}, the ARI for $CC(10, s)$ is 1.0 for $s > 1$, meaning that the true labels perfectly align with those predicted by the Consensus matrix).}
	\label{fig:simSmallNLargePCMs}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:simPrediction}, limiting behaviour for increases of $S$ and $R$ can be seen for the ensemble. For most simulations there is no change in performance for greater choices of $S$ and $R$ after some stabilising values.
%An example of this exact behaviour can be seen in figure \ref{fig:simSmallNLargePCMs}. In this example there is no change in the Consensus matrix between the three ensembles for $(10, 50)$, $(100, 30)$ and $(100, 50)$; here $(R, S)$ denotes the ensemble with chain depth of $R$ and $S$ different chains. 

%This inspires our belief that the ensemble depth and width should be grown until this limiting behaviours emerge. In practice where no ground truth is available to compare the ARI values, we recommend visually inspecting the Consensus matrices in a grid like figures \ref{fig:simCMsIrr100}, \ref{fig:simNoStructCMs} and \ref{fig:simSmallNLargePCMs} and checking if there is any noticeable difference between the Consensus matrices for some sets of chain depth, $R'=\{r_1, \ldots, r_a\}$, and chain length $S'=\{s_1, \ldots, s_b\}$ (where $r_i < r_j \iff i < j$ and $s_i < s_j \iff i < j$ for all $i, j$). If there is no difference between the Consensus matrix for $(r_i, s_j)$ and that for $(r_a, s_b)$ for any $i = 1, \ldots, a - 1$, $j = 1, \ldots, b - 1$ than the limiting behaviour is assumed to have emerged. For example, in figure \ref{fig:simSmallNLargePCMs} this limiting behaviour appears to have emerged by $R=10$ and $S=10$, but this can only be seen by comparing the ensembles of $R = 10, S = 30$ and $R=100, S = 10$ with $R= 100, S= 30$. We suggest that $\frac{r_a}{r_{a - 1}} \leq 0.5, \frac{s_b}{s_{b-1}} \leq 0.5$ and $r_a, s_b \geq 50$.

%Beyond the empricial behaviour of the ensembles in this simulation study, this heuristic is also inspired by the belief that a clustering method should produce stable results across similar datasets \citep{von2005towards, meinshausen2010stability}. We believe that if the method is still producing a partition that is visibly changing for additional chains and depth, than the random initialisation is influencing the result sufficiently that it is unlikely to be stable for similar datasets or reproducible for a random choice of seeds. % given that is the method is not stable even within the same dataset.

\section{Yeast} \label{sec:yeast}

The cell cycle is the process by which a growing cell divides into two daughter cells. This involves virtually all cellular processes - metabolism, protein synthesis, secretion, DNA replication, organelle biogenesis, cytoskeletal dynamics and chromosome segregation - and diverse regulatory events \citep{granovskaia2010high}. The cell cycle is crucial to biological growth, repair, reproduction, and development; it is fundamental to sustaining life \citep{tyson2013cell, chen2004integrative, alberts2018molecular}. The regulatory proteins of the system first appeared over a billion years ago and are so highly conserved among eukaryotes that many of them function perfectly when transferred from a human cell to a yeast cell \citep{alberts2018molecular}. This conservation means that a relatively simple eukaryote such as \emph{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} can provide insight into a variety of cell cycle perturbations including those that occur in human cancer \citep{ingalls2007systems, chen2004integrative} and ageing \citep{jimenez2015live}. Budding yeast is particularly attractive for genetic analysis as it can proliferate as haploid cells, its genetic makeup can be easily altered by standard tools of molecular genetics, and large numbers of cells may be synchronised in a particular stage of the cell cycle  \citep{tyson2013cell, juanes2017methods}.


%Cell-cycle data is exciting as virtually all cellular processes - metabolism, protein synthesis, secretion, DNA replication, organelle biogenesis, cytoskeletal dynamics and chromosome segregation - and diverse regulatory events emerge \citep{granovskaia2010high}. 

%It is also naturally suited to integrative analyis as many of the protein encoding genes in the mitotic cell cycle have well studied genomic binding sites with mapped transcription factors that control phase-specific expression \citep{cho1998genome, spellman1998comprehensive}. Post-translational regulation also contributes to control of timing of cell-cycle progression in addition to the transcriptional regulation. Thus we hope that for many of our genes that the integration of cell-cycle data, transcription factor data and PPI data should provide meaningful clusters.

%Why?
%
%\cite{alberts2018molecular}: The proteins of the control system first appeared over a billion years ago. Remarkably, they have been so well conserved over the course of evolution that many of them function perfectly when transferred from a human cell to a yeast cell.
%
%\cite{ingalls2007systems}: Proteins involved in the regulation of the cell cycle are highly conserved across all eukaryotes, and so a relatively simple eukaryote such as yeast can provide insight into a variety of cell cycle perturbations including those that occur in human cancer. 
%
%\cite{chen2004integrative}: Cell proliferation underlies all biological growth, reproduction, and development, and its misregulation results in serious human diseases. 
%
%The cell cycle is the sequence of events during which a growing cell replicates all its components and divides them more or less evenly between two daughter cells, so that each daughter contains the information and machinery necessary to repeat the process 
%
%
%\cite{tyson2013cell}: The cell cycle of budding yeast has become a hallmark problem of molecular systems biology for a number of reasons. (1) The cycle of DNA replication, mitosis, and cell division is crucial to all aspects of biological growth, development, and reproduction. (2) The genes and pathways for cell cycle control seem to be very similar in all eukaryotes, including mammals. (3) Budding yeast is exceptionally good for genetic analysis of cell cycle controls because it can proliferate as haploid cells, and its genetic makeup can be easily altered by standard tools of molecular genetics. For this reason, a great deal is known about the molecular machinery regulating the events of the budding yeast cell cycle. (4) The machinery is very complicated, and its properties cannot be worked out reliably by intuitive reasoning alone.

%\cite{jimenez2015live}: Our understanding of lifespan has benefited enormously from the study of a simple model, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although a uni-cellular organism, yeasts undergo many of the processes directly related with aging that to some extent are conserved in mammalian cells.

%\end{itemize}

To better understand the regulatory mechanisms and the genes most important in this process, we performed an integrative cluster analysis of gene products across three yeast datasets. These datasets were generated using different 'omics technologies and target different aspects of the molecular biology underpinning the cell cycle process.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Microarray profiles of RNA expression from \cite{granovskaia2010high}. This dataset comprises measurements of cell-cycle-regulated expression at 5-minute intervals for 41 time points (up to three cell division cycles) and is referred to as the \textbf{Timecourse} dataset. We include only the genes identified by \cite{granovskaia2010high} as having periodic expression profiles. This includes some non-coding RNAs (\textbf{ncRNAs}) of which the majority are anti-sense RNAs.
	\item Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by microarray hybridization (\textbf{ChIP-chip}) data from \cite{harbison2004transcriptional}. This dataset discretizes $p$-values from tests of association between 117 DNA-binding transcriptional regulators and a set of yeast genes. Based upon a significance threshold these $p$-values are represented as either a 0 (no interaction) or a 1 (an interaction).
	\item Protein-protein interaction (\textbf{PPI}) data from BioGrid \citep{stark2006biogrid}. This database consists of of physical and genetic interactions between gene and gene products. The interactions included are a collection of results observed in high throughput experiments and some computationally inferred interactions. The dataset we used contained 603 proteins as columns. An entry of 1  in the $(i, j)^{th}$ cell indicates that the $i^{th}$ gene has a protein product that is believed to interact with the $j^{th}$ protein.
\end{itemize}
We used these datasets to construct sets of co-regulated genes that share biological functions in \emph{Saccharomyces cerevisiae}. We believe such informed gene sets are more relevant to phenotypic traits and offer insight into more complex biological processes. 
%We used these datasets to perform an integrative analyis as many of the protein encoding genes in the mitotic cell cycle have well studied genomic binding sites with mapped transcription factors that control phase-specific expression \citep{cho1998genome, spellman1998comprehensive}. Post-translational regulation also contributes to control of timing of cell-cycle progression in addition to the transcriptional regulation. Thus we hope that for many of our genes that the integration of cell-cycle data, transcription factor data and PPI data should provide meaningful clusters.


%To construct these sets we performed an integrative cluster analysis incorporating more biological meaning than is possible in analysis of a single experiment.

We believe that the integrative aspect of the experiments means that the clusters are more interpretable than in a standalone cluster analysis. Cluster analysis of a single dataset entails interpreting the clusters defined by similarity within a single experiment which often involves strong assumptions about the biological processes behind the result (e.g. correlation of transcripts implies co-regulation).

%Furthermore, integrative analysis means that power may be loaned between datasets - for example the ChIP-chip dataset involved discreization based upon $p$-values. By clustering this data with the Timecourse dataset, genes which have similar behaviour in the Timecourse dataset and some similarity in the ChIP-chip data may be clustered together

%We included three datasets that are generated using different techniques. We expect that including measurements from a variety of experiments offers more useful information about specific genes and their products than any single type of 'omics data. 

We used the MDI model for our integrative analysis. This jointly models the clustering in each dataset, inferring individual clusterings for each dataset that are informed by similarity in the other clusterings. As described in section \ref{sec:models}, MDI learns the similarity between the datasets being analysed and does not assume global structure. This means that the similarity between datasets is not strongly assumed in our model; individual clusters or genes that align across datasets are based solely upon the evidence present in the data not strong modelling assumptions. Thus we can include the PPI data and expect it to contribute to our final clustering despite the expectation that there will be less shared information between the Timecourse dataset with its large set of ncRNAs might and this PPI dataset.

%The additional information from the integrative analysis for each gene and the flexible joint model improve our ability to interpret the clusters that emerge as biological constructs without forcing meaning via agressive assumptions or excessive structure \emph{a priori} due to our model choice (e.g. a model that assumes a global generating structure across all datasets).

% We are attempting to learn about higher-level processes that individual genes. To enable this we include more information and use a flexible joint model to improve our ability to interpret the clusters that emerge as biological constructs without forcing \emph{a priori} structure via assumptions (e.g. that co-expressed genes are co-regulated) or our model choice (e.g. a model that assumes a global generating structure across all datasets). Performing individual cluster analyses on each dataset means that 

%Our \textbf{Yeast dataset} consists of three datasets with different types of gene products associated with a common set of 551 genes. 
%The datasets are:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item microarray profiles of RNA expression from \cite{granovskaia2010high}. This dataset comprises measurements of cell-cycle-regulated expression at 5-minute intervals for 41 time points (up to three cell division cycles) and is referred to as the \textbf{Timecourse} dataset. We include only the genes identified by \cite{granovskaia2010high} as having periodic expression profiles. This includes some non-coding RNAs (\textbf{ncRNAs}) of which the majority are anti-sense RNAs.
%	\item Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by microarray hybridization (\textbf{ChIP-chip}) data from \cite{harbison2004transcriptional}. This dataset has comprises measurements across 117 DNA-binding transcriptional regulators.
%	\item Protein-protein interaction (\textbf{PPI}) data from BioGrid \citep{stark2006biogrid}. This database consists of of physical and genetic interactions between gene and gene products. The interactions included are a collection of results observed in high throughput experiments and some computationally inferred interactions. The dataset we used contained 603 proteins.
%\end{itemize}
The datasets were reduced to 551 items by considering only the genes with no missing data in the PPI and ChIP-chip data. The choices to reduce the datasets to these 551 genes are the same steps as in \cite{kirk2012bayesian}. The datasets are shown in figure \ref{fig:yeastData}.

%Cell-cycle data is exciting as virtually all cellular processes - metabolism, protein synthesis, secretion, DNA replication, organelle biogenesis, cytoskeletal dynamics and chromosome segregation - and diverse regulatory events emerge \citep{granovskaia2010high}. It is also naturally suited to integrative analyis as many of the protein encoding genes in the mitotic cell cycle have well studied genomic binding sites with mapped transcription factors that control phase-specific expression \citep{cho1998genome, spellman1998comprehensive}. Post-translational regulation also contributes to control of timing of cell-cycle progression in addition to the transcriptional regulation. Thus we hope that for many of our genes that the integration of cell-cycle data, transcription factor data and PPI data should provide meaningful clusters.

We used these datasets to perform an integrative analyis as many of the protein encoding genes in the mitotic cell cycle have well studied genomic binding sites with mapped transcription factors that control phase-specific expression \citep{cho1998genome, spellman1998comprehensive}; thus the inclusion of the ChIP-chip data means that the clusters that align across the datasets should include well studied regulatory proteins and thus be of biological interest. If a cluster of genes are similarly expressed in the Timecourse, share associated regulatory protein in the ChIP-chip and are associated with common protein complexes in the PPI data, than this implies a gene set with strong biological significance.
%Post-translational regulation also contributes to control of timing of cell-cycle progression in addition to the transcriptional regulation. Thus we hope that for many of our genes that the integration of cell-cycle data, transcription factor data and PPI data should provide meaningful clusters.

In contrast, if we cluster the Timecourse dataset alone, any clusters that we find are defined by correlation across time. This might be assumed to be driven by shared regulatory mechanisms, but other sources of structure might be encouraging this, even experimental error. However, if a cluster aligns across both the Timecourse dataset and the ChIP-chip dataset we can be more certain that these genes are part of some regulatory network; if this cluster also emerges in the PPI dataset we might believe that the genes are co-regulated as part of the formation of some protein complex. Furthermore, this integrative aspect means that clusters that might merge in the Timecourse dataset due to similar periodicity in a standalone analysis might remain separate due to different associated transcription factors in the ChIP-chip dataset.

Thus we performed an integrative analysis using MDI to avoid agressive assumptions about either the biology defining any clusters and modelling assumptions about the latent structure.

%The MDI model allows different clusters to align across datasets but does not enforce a global structure; this means that individual clusters or even genes can align across datasets based upon the evidence present in the data without forcing global alignment. Thus we can include the PPI data and expect it to contribute to our final clustering despite the expectation that the ncRNAs might not have common cluster allocation across the Timecourse and PPI datasets.

We expect that the complexity of this data and model means that the time required for convergence of the MCMC algorithm would be very large. We avoid this problem by using Consensus clustering of MDI, instead basing our final ensemble choice on the stopping rule laid out in section \ref{sec:stopping}.

The datasets were modelled using a mixture of Gaussian processes in the Timecourse dataset and Multinomial distributions in the ChIP-chip and PPI datasets. To ensure that our mixture model is initially overfitted we set $K_{max}=275\approx\frac{N}{2}$.

\subsubsection{Ensemble choice}
We use an ensemble of depth $R=10001$ and width $S=1000$ with a base learner of MDI \citep[using the software implementation from][]{mason2016mdi}. This ensemble depth and width were decided using the stopping rule from section \ref{sec:stopping}. We include the Consensus matrices for this ensemble and those for the combinations of $R = (1001, 5001, 10001)$, $S=(100, 500, 1,000)$ in the three datasets (shown in figures \ref{fig:timecourseCMs}, \ref{fig:chipchipCMs} and \ref{fig:ppiCMs}) and a plot of the mean squared difference between the Consensus matrix for $R=10001$ and $S=1000$ to a range of smaller and shallower ensembles (figure \ref{fig:ensembleChoice}).

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{./Images/Yeast/EnsembleChoicePlot.png}
	\caption{The mean squared difference between the Consensus matrix for chain depth $R$ and $S$ chains to the Consensus matrix for chain depth 10,001 and 1,000 chains. We find that increasing $S$ beyond 100 has marginal effect except in the PPI dataset where values have stabilised by $S=500$. The changes in item coclustering across the ensemble changes very slightly for chains deeper than 5,000.}
	\label{fig:ensembleChoice}
\end{figure}

%Following the logic inspired by the behaviour seen in section \ref{sec:simModelPerformance}, we decide the ensemble is sufficiently deep and wide to stop growing if,  for a given depth $r$ and width $s$, there is no visible difference between the Consensus matrices from the ensembles using $R=(a r, r)$, $S=(s, b s)$. In our analysis we used $a=b=0.5$ (the smaller the choice of $a,b$ the more extreme the stopping criterion). An example of this logic can be seen in figures \ref{fig:chipchipCMs} and \ref{fig:ppiCMs} (and to a lesser degree in figure \ref{fig:timecourseCMs}). 

We decide to stop increasing at $R=10001$ as there is little change between Consensus matrices for increasing chain depth from $R=5001$ to $R=10001$ across the three datasets. An example of insufficient depth can be see for $R=1001$ in figure \ref{fig:ppiCMs}; there is a marked difference in the Consensus matrices between $R=1001$ and $R=5001$. 

In terms of the number of chains required, we believe this to have stabilised, as there is no obvious change in increasing $S$ from 100 in the Timecourse and ChiP-chip datasets, and none in any dataset for increasing from $S=500$ to $S=1000$.

\subsection{Cluster analysis}
We use \texttt{maxpear} to infer an estimate clustering from the Consensus matrices as in the Simulations except we set \texttt{k.max = 275}.

\subsubsection{Fused genes}
We wish to identify groups of genes that tend to be grouped together in multiple datasets. We use the concept of \emph{fused genes} proposed by \cite{savage2010discovering} and used by \cite{kirk2012bayesian}, but to avoid confusion due to other possible ideas of fused genes (e.g. those that contribute to a common protein complex, the behaviour of TFs upon a gene) we use the term \emph{integrated}. We define a gene to be integrated across some set of datasets if the gene has the same label in each of these datasets for at least half of the recorded clustering samples. Integrated genes are those most affected by the integrative aspect of the analysis and therefore we focus upon these in the following analysis. In our case we have the possible sets of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\{$Timecourse$\}$, $\{$ChIP-chip$\}$, $\{$PPI$\}$,
	\item $\{$Timecourse, ChIP-chip$\}$, $\{$Timecourse, PPI$\}$, $\{$ChIP-chip, PPI$\}$, and
	\item $\{$Timecourse, ChIP-chip, PPI$\}$.
\end{itemize}
Any set of a single dataset is the trivial case that all genes are considered integrated.

The number of integrated genes between any two datasets is indicative of how strongly they influence eachother and is expected to align with the $\phi_{lm}$ parameters from the MDI model. We find the following number of unqiue genes integrated between each combination of datasets:
\begin{itemize}	
	\item Timecourse + ChIP-chip + PPI: 56,
	\item Timecourse + ChIP-chip: 205 (261 including the 56 integrated across all datasets),
	\item Timecourse + PPI: 12 (68),
	\item ChIP-chip + PPI: 43 (99).
.
\end{itemize}
which aligns with the sampled $\phi_{lm}$ values in figure \ref{fig:ccPhiDensities}, which shows that the Timecourse and ChIP-chip datasets contain very similar structure, the ChIP-chip and PPI datasets have some similarity but significantly less and the Timecourse and PPI datasets have less similarity again. 
%Note that the 56 genes that integrate across all three datasets must also integrate in all of the pair combinations of datasets.

Compare this to the original analysis of this data in \cite{kirk2012bayesian}, where the number of integrated genes in each combination is:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Timecourse + ChIP-chip + PPI: 16,
	\item Timecourse + ChIP-chip: 32 (48),
	\item Timecourse + PPI: 16 (32),
	\item ChIP-chip + PPI: 15 (31).
\end{itemize}
Our analysis has found significantly more shared structure.

	\caption{The sampled values for the $\phi$ parameters from the learners constituting the ensemble. High values indicate similar structure, low values indicate less, with 0 implying that the clustering models on each dataset are independent. The Timecourse dataset is represented by an index of 1, ChIP-chip by 2 and the PPI data by 3.}

In figure \ref{fig:timepointChIPchipFused} we show the data from the Timecourse and ChIP-chip datasets for the genes that integrated between these datasets. In this plot we exclude the 15 clusters where more than half of the member genes have no interactions in the ChIP-chip data and any clusters of one. We find that a small number of transcription factors dominate, with different combinations emerging across the 10 clusters shown here in table \ref{tab:fusedTFs}. Many of these 10 correspond to transcription factors that are well known to regulate cell cycle expression, namely MBP1, SWI4, SWI6, MCM1, FKH1, FKH2, NDD1, SWI5, and ACE2 \citep{simon2001serial}.

%\cite{iyer2001genomic}: SBF and MBF are sequence-specific transcription factors that activate gene expression during the G1/S transition of the cell cycle in yeast. SBF is a heterodimer of Swi4 and Swi6, and MBF is a heterodimer of Mbpl and Swi6. Our results support the hypothesis that SBF activated genes are predominantly involved in budding, and in membrane and cell-wall biosynthesis, whereas DNA replication and repair are the dominant functions among MBF activated genes.

These regulatory proteins are found in different combinations across the clusters. Based upon these combinations we associate each cluster with phases of the cell cycle and or some specific processes.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Cluster 1: both AC2 and SWI5 emerge. These regulate specific genes at the end of M and early G1 \citep{mcbride1999distinct, simon2001serial}.
	\item Cluster 2: SWI5. This is similar to cluster 1, as ACE2 is a paralog of SWI5; therefore associated with M/G1. Furthermore, inspection of the expression in the timecourse data shows that the members of cluster 2 largely differentiate from those of cluster 1 based upon amplitude, not periodicity, suggesting that these clusters could be merged.
	\item Cluster 5: MBP1, SWI4 and SWI6. The SBF complex (Swi4p-Swi6p) is a transcriptional activator that in concert with	MBF (Mbp1-Swi6p) regulates late G1-specific transcription of targets including cyclins and genes required for DNA synthesis and repair, controlling the transition to S phase \citep{simon2001serial,iyer2001genomic, aligianni2009fission}. Inspection of the individual genes in cluster reveals that many are late G1 genes.
	\item Cluster 9: MBP1 and SWI6. These combine to form MBF, which regulates DNA replication and repair \citep{iyer2001genomic}. The gene members of this cluster are predominantly involved in DNA replication and repair.
	\item Cluster 11: DIG1, SWI4, SWI6, and STE12 emerge in all members with some having associations with TEC1. TEC1 and STE12, controls development, including cell adhesion and filament formation and is negatively regulated by DIG1 and DIG2 \citep{van2014transcription}.
	\item Cluster 12: MBP1 , SWI4 and SWI6. Similar to cluster 5 in both the Timecourse and ChIP-chip datasets and thus G1/S phase.
	\item Cluster 16: some MBP1, SWI4 and SWI6. The constituents of this cluster are largely associated with proteins contributing to histones H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, suggesting an S-phase cluster \citep{ewen2000cell}.
	\item Cluster 17: FKH1 and FKH2. Fkh1p and Fkh2p are required for cell-cycle regulation of transcription during G2/M \citep{kumar2000forkhead}. 
%	Transcription elongation and chromatim silencing, G2/M phase. Many of the gene members are involved in spindle assembly and chromatin remodelling.
%	Both FKH1 and FKH2 are also periodically transcribed and peak in S phase \cite{zhu2000two}. 
%	 FKH1 regulates transcription elongation, chromatin silencing at mating loci,	expression of G2/M phase genes. FKH2 binds multiple chromosomal elements with distinct specificities, cell cycle dynamics; positively regulates transcriptional elongation; facilitates clustering, activation of early-ring replication origins; negative role in chromatin silencing at HML and HMR; major role in expression of G2/M phase genes;
%	\item  Cluster 18 is a singleton
	\item Cluster 20: NDD1 and MCM1 with some FKH2. Mcm1, together with Fkh1 or Fkh2, recruits the Ndd1 protein in late G2, and thus controls the transcription of G2/M genes \citep{simon2001serial, koranda2000forkhead}. 
%	\cite{breeden2000cyclin} NDD1 and FKH2 transcription is initiated in S phase and the nascent Ndd1 binds the Mcm1–Fkh2–DNA complex at that time.
%	 MCM1 is involved in cell-type-specific transcription and pheromone response; plays a central role in the formation of both repressor and activator complexes. 
%	NDD1 is essential for nuclear division; essential component of the mechanism that activates the expression of a set of late-S-phase-specific genes 
%	\cite{koranda2000forkhead} find that NDD1, a positive regulator, becomes associated with G2/M promoter regions in manner that depends on the stage in cell cycle. Its recruitment depends on a permanent protein–DNA complex consisting of the MADS box protein, MCM1, and a recently identified partner Fkh2, a forkhead/winged helix related transcription factor. The lethality of Ndd1 depletion is suppressed by fkh2 null mutations, which indicates that Fkh2 may also have a negative regulatory role in the transcription of G2/M-induced RNAs.
%	Mcm1, together with Fkh1 or Fkh2, recruits the Ndd1 protein in late G2, and thus controls the transcription of G2/M genes. \cite{simon2001serial}.
%	\cite{breeden2000cyclin} Mcm1 binds as a dimer to its recognition site throughout the cycle. Binding of Fkh2 to the adjacent SFF site is dependent upon Mcm1 binding and can also be detected throughout the cell cycle. NDD1 and FKH2 transcription is initiated in S phase and the nascent Ndd1 protein binds the Mcm1–Fkh2–DNA complex at that time.
	\item Cluster 26: YOX1 and MCM1. YOX1 binds to Mcm1p and to early cell cycle boxes (ECBs) in the promoters of cell cycle-regulated genes expressed in M/G1 phase \citep{pramila2002conserved}.

	\caption{The fused clusters across the Timecourse and ChIP-chip datasets (as described in tbale \ref{tab:timecoursChIPchipFused}). We exclude the clusters with no interactions in the ChIP-chip dataset and include a red line for the Transcription factors that dominate the clustering structure in the ChIP-chip dataset.}
	\label{fig:timepointChIPchipFused}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

%We find that several of the clusters in the Timecourse dataset have similar periods but different amplitudes (due to the choice of scaling factor). One might be tempted, as suggested by some practitioners, that a post-hoc, manual merging of clusters might improve the analysis. However, this is another benefit of MDI 

\subsubsection{Cluster 16}
Histone proteins and then three others, GAS3, NRM1 and PDS1.

GAS3 is a poorly understood gene. We find that it is associated with HEK2 and SMT3 in the PPI data and SWI6, FKH2 and FKH1 in the ChIP-chip data. 

%Yox1p may function together with Nrm1p to confine MBF-dependent transcription to the G1/S transition of the cell cycle via negative feedback \cite{aligianni2009fission}. Is cluster 16 separated from cluster 12 due to the scaling of the timecourse data?

%Evidence that they are the same:
%The divergently transcribed histone H3 and H4 genes (hht1 and hhf1, respectively) show enrichment of Yox1p (red), but not of Cdc10p (blue), 
%
%Two negative feedback loops have previously been reported to constrain transcription to G1/S by promoting timely repression of MBF-dependent genes: 1) the cyclin Cig2p, whose gene is activated by MBF, in turn inhibits MBF activity in G2-phase by phosphorylating Res1p [19]; and 2) Nrm1p, whose gene is also activated by MBF, in turn acts as a transcriptional co-repressor for MBF-dependent genes much like Yox1p. 
%
%these findings suggest that Yox1p and Nrm1p operate in the same negative feedback loop in which the role of Yox1p in transcriptional repression depends on Nrm1p. Whether Nrm1p depends on Yox1p for its association with MBF or is a connector protein required for Yox1p-dependent repression of MBF-regulated transcription remains to be determined.
%
%Besides the negative feedback loop based on Yox1p, both yeasts also seem to apply positive feedback loops based on the SBF-regulated SWI4 in budding yeast \cite{mcinerny1997novel, foster1993multiple}
%
%In conclusion, we have uncovered an additional regulatory layer, based on the homeodomain protein Yox1p, to switch-off MBF-dependent transcription during S-phase progression. Similar roles have been identified for Cig2p and Nrm1p. 

\cite{kumar2000forkhead}: Fkh1p and Fkh2p are required for cell-cycle regulation of transcription during G2/M. Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1p and Fkh2p, collaborate with Mcm1p to control transcription required for M-phase


\begin{itemize}
	\item FKH1: Fkh1p cooperates with Isw1p to remodel chromatin during G2/M. FKH1 has additional roles in the establishment of chromatin silencing at the silent mating-type cassette and in the regulation of donor preference during mating type switching. FKH1 and the Swi4p/Swi6p-containing SCB-binding factor (SBF - note that NRM1 also depends upon SBF) independently regulate donor preference through direct interactions with a cis-acting sequence called the recombination enhancer, with Fkh1p binding in the G2 phase and SBF binding in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. 
	\item FKH2: negative role in chromatin silencing at HML and HMR.
	\item SWI6: Transcription cofactor. FKH1 and the Swi6p-containing SCB-binding factor (SBF) independently regulate donor preference through direct interactions with a cis-acting sequence called the recombination enhancer, with Fkh1p binding in the G2 phase and SBF binding in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.
	\item HEK2: RNA binding protein involved in asymmetric localization of ASH1 mRNA; represses translation of ASH1 mRNA, an effect reversed by Yck1p-dependent phosphoryation; regulates telomere position effect and length; similarity to hnRNP-K.
	\item SMT3: regulates chromatid cohesion, chromosome segregation, APC-mediated proteolysis, DNA replication and septin ring dynamics.
\end{itemize}
This suggests that GAS3 might be assoicated with anaphase?
Sister chromatid cohesion ensures the faithful segregation of chromosomes in mitosis and in both meiotic divisions \citep{cooper2009pds1p}.

 chormatin stuff? Not sure how to state this. Try: This association with the forkhead regulators and SMT3 along with the clustering alongside the histone genes suggests that GAS3 might have some role in DNA replication/chromatim stuff (I don't know this biology well enough)  (``guilt by association'').

\textbf{PDS1}: PDS1p is an important regulator of the onset of anaphase both for the Anaphase Promoting Complex and checkpoint pathways. \citep{yamamoto1996pds1p, wang2001pds1}. An ESP1/PDS1 complex regulates loss of sister chromatid cohesion at the metaphase to anaphase transition in yeast \citep{ciosk1998esp1}. This places PDS1 firmly in the M phase of the cell cycle. 

Pds1p destruction is required for metaphase I–anaphase I transition \citep{cooper2009pds1p}. 

also involved in recombinational repair,

%The DNA damage check- point(s)  requires products encoded by RAD9,  RAD17, RAD24, MECI, MEC3, and RAD53 (MEC2/SAD1) genes while the spindle-damage checkpoint(s) requires a  differ- ent set of products encoded by BUB1, BUB2, BUB3, MAD1,  MAD2, and MAD3 genes (Weinert and Hartwell, 1988, 1993; Hoyt et al.,  1991; Li and Murray, 1991; Allen et al., 1994; Weinart et al., 1994). \citep{yamamoto1996pds1p}

%Pds1 is an anaphase inhibitor and plays an essential role in DNA damage and spindle checkpoint pathways \cite{wang2001pds1}.

%An ESP1/PDS1 complex regulates loss of sister chromatid cohesion at the metaphase to anaphase transition in yeast \citep{ciosk1998esp1}.

\textbf{NRM1}: transciprtional co-repressor of MBF-regulated gene expression acting at the transition from G1 to S phase \citep{de2006constraining, aligianni2009fission}. NRMA1 is phosphorylated in response to DNA replication stress, promoting its disassocation from MBF \citep{de2008dna}. 

%Transcriptional co-repressor of MBF-regulated gene expression; Nrm1p associates stably with promoters via MCB binding factor (MBF) to repress transcription upon exit from G1 phase. Approximately half of the members of cluster 16 have an interaction with MBP in the ChIP-chip data, and some have SWI6 too, so there might be something here.

%NRM1, an MBF-specific transcriptional repressor acting at the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle, is at the nexus between the cell cycle transcriptional program and the DNA replication checkpoint in fission yeast. Phosphorylation of Nrm1 by the Cds1 (Chk2) checkpoint protein kinase, which is activated in response to DNA replication stress, promotes its dissociation from the MBF transcription factor. \cite{de2008dna}

%G1-specific transcription in yeast depends upon SBF and MBF. We have identified NRM1 (negative regulator of MBF targets 1), as a stable component of MBF. NRM1(YNR009w), an MBF-regulated gene expressed during late G1 phase, associates with G1-specific promoters via MBF. Transcriptional repression upon exit from G1 phase requires both NRM1 and MBF. Inactivation of NRM1 results in prolonged expression of MBF-regulated transcripts and leads to hydroxyurea (HU) resistance and enhanced bypass of RAD53D- and MEC1D-associated lethality. Constitutive expression of a stabilized form of Nrm1 represses MBF targets and leads to HU sensitivity. The fission yeast homolog SpNrm1, encoded by the MBF target genenrm1+(SPBC16A3.07c), binds to MBF target genes and acts as a corepressor. In both yeasts, MBF represses G1-specific transcription outside of G1 phase. A negative feedback loop involving Nrm1 bound to MBF leads to transcriptional repression as cells exit G1 phase. \citep{de2006constraining}

%Yox1p may function together with Nrm1p to confine MBF-dependent transcription to the G1/S transition of the cell cycle via negative feedback \cite{aligianni2009fission}.

%MBF represses G1-specific transcription outside of G1 phase. A negative feedback loop involving Nrm1 bound to MBF leads to transcriptional repression as cells exit G1 phase. \citep{de2006constraining}

%Is NRM1 being transcribed as we move into S-phase, repressing G1 transcripts before the DNA is replicated - histone comes into play here?

\subsubsection{Cluster 12}
The regulation of the G1- to S-phase transition is critical for cell-cycle progression. This transition is driven by a transient transcriptional wave regulated by transcription factor complexes termed MBF/SBF in yeast \cite{aligianni2009fission}.
Yox1p homeodomain protein of fission yeast plays a critical role in confining MBF-dependent transcription to the G1/S transition of the cell cycle. \cite{aligianni2009fission}. Cluster 12 is g1/S? Associated with SWI6/MBP1 (i.e. MBF). 

\cite{aligianni2009fission}: Transcript levels of many genes fluctuate periodically as a function of cell growth and division, peaking at specific phases of each cell cycle. Such cell cycle-regulated gene expression seems to be a universal feature of proliferating cells [1]–[3]. The best characterized transcriptional wave is induced during the G1/S transition, named ‘Start’ in yeast and ‘restriction point’ in mammalian cells, when cells commit to DNA replication and thus to a new cell-division cycle. 
E2F-DP complexes control G1/S transcription and are deregulated in most cancer cells, highlighting the importance of this regulation
MBF activates transcription during the G1/S transition, binding to MCB promoter elements that are conserved from yeasts to humans.

\subsection{Bayesian analysis} \label{sec:yeastBayesianAnalysis}
We ran 10 chains of MDI for 36 hours saving every thousandth sample. This resulted in chains of varying length. We reduced the chains to 666 samples as this was the number of samples achieved by the slowest chain. Similar to section \ref{sec:simBayesianAnalysis} these chains were then investigated for 
\begin{itemize}
	\item within-chain stationarity using the Geweke convergence diagnostic \citep{geweke1991evaluating}, and
	\item across-chain convergence using $\hat{R}$ \citep{gelman1992inference} and the Vats-Knudson extension \citep[\emph{stable $\hat{R}$},][]{vats2018revisiting}.
\end{itemize}
%The Geweke convergence diagnostic is a standard Z-score; it compares the sample mean of two sets of samples (in this case buckets of samples from the first half of the samples to the sample mean of the entire second half of samples). It is calculated under the assumption that the two parts of the chain are asymptotically independent and if this assumption holds than the scores are expected to be standard normally distributed presenting evidence for within chain stationarity.
%
%$\hat{R}$ is expected to approach 1.0 if the set of chains are converged. Low $\hat{R}$ is not sufficient in itself to claim chain convergence, but values above 1.1 are clear evidence for a lack of convergence \citep{gelman2013bayesian}. \cite{vats2018revisiting} show that this threshold is significantly too high (1.01 being a better choice) and propose extensions to $\hat{R}$ that enable a more formal rule for a threshold. It is their method as implemented in the R package \texttt{stableGR} \citep{knudson20202stableGR} that is the final check of convergence.
%
Again we focus upon stationarity of the continuous variables. In the implementation of MDI we used, the recorded continuous variables are the concentration parameters of the Dirichlet distribution for the dataset-specific component weights and the $\phi_{ij}$ parameter associated with the correlation between the $i^{th}$ and $j^{th}$ datasets. 
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{./Images/Yeast/Convergence/gewekePlot.png}
	\caption{Chain 9 can be seen to have the most extreme behaviour in the distribution of the Geweke diagnostic for the parameters. We remove this chain from the analysis. Of the remaining chains we believe that 1, 2, 4 and 6 express the distributions furthest removed from the desired behaviour and are dropped from the analysis.}

\end{figure}

%\begin{figure}
%	\centering
%	\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{./Images/Yeast/Convergence/gewekePhiChain.png}
%	\caption{None of the chains appear to be standard normal in their distribution. Chain 4 behaves very strangely and is also dropped from the analysis. Of the remaining chains there is less clear distinctions, but chains 1, 2, and 6 appear most extreme and thus are dropped.}
%	\label{fig:gewekePhiPlot}
%\end{figure}
We plot the Geweke-statistic for each chain in figure \ref{fig:gewekePlot}. No chain is perfectly behaved; as we cannot reduce to the set of stationary chains we thus exclude the most poorly behaved chains. Our lack of belief in the convergence of these chains is fortified by the behaviour of $\hat{R}$ (which can be seen in figure \ref{fig:gelmanPlot}) and the different distributions sampled for the $\phi_{lm}$ parameters shown in figure \ref{fig:bayesDensities}.
%where the values of $\hat{R}$ do not drop below 1.25 for the $\phi$ parameters. Stable $\hat{R}$ is also too high, with several million more samples recommended before convergence is expected.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{./Images/Yeast/Convergence/gelmanPlot.png}
	\caption{The chains still appear to be unconverged with $\hat{R}$ remaining above 1.25 for the $\phi_{12}, \phi_{13}$ and $\phi_{23}$ parameters. Stable $\hat{R}$ is also too high with values of 1.049, 1.052 and 1.057 for $\phi_{12}, \phi_{13}$ and $\phi_{23}$ respectively.}

It can be seen that different modes are being sampled for the $\phi$ parameters in each chain.

	\label{fig:bayesDensities}
\end{figure}

We visualise the the PSMs for each dataset in figure \ref{fig:yeastPSMs}. 
%The Timecourse data appears to have only the mildest of disagreement between the PSMs from different chains (see figure \ref{fig:timecoursePSMs}). The lack of convergence between chains emerges in the ChIP-chip data (figure \ref{fig:chipchipPSMs}) and, to a far greater degree, in the PPI data (figure \ref{fig:ppiPSMs}).

%\end{figure}

If we compare the distribution of sampled values for the $\phi$ parameters for the Bayesian chains that we keep based upon their convergence diagnostics, the final ensemble used ($R=10001$, $S=1000$) and the pooled samples from the 5 long chains, then we see that the ensemble consisting of the long chains (which might be believed to sampling different parts of the posterior distribution) is closer in its appearance to the distributions sampled by the Consensus clustering than to any single chain. There is no consistent distribution across the chains, but it appears that Consensus clustering is producing a distribution that does have similar behaviour to the overlap of the chains.

	\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{./Images/Yeast/ComparisonDensities.png}
	\caption{The sampled values for the $\phi$ parameters from the long chains, their pooled samples and the consensus using 1000 chains of depth 10,001. The long chains display a variety of behaviours. Across chains there is no clear consensus on the nature of the posterior distribution. The samples from any single chain are not particularly close to the behaviour of the pooled samples across all three parameters. It is the Consensus clustering that most approaches this pooled behaviour.}

\end{figure}

%Evidence for this can also be seen in the coherent clusters of time series from the Timecourse dataset in figure \ref{fig:timecourseCCTimeSeries}.



\subsection{GO term over-representation} \label{sec:goTermOverRep}
To validate the predicted clusters we tested if they contained a higher concentration of specific Gene Ontology (GO) terms than would be expected by chance. We estimated clusterings from the PSMs of the chains kept from section \ref{sec:yeastBayesianAnalysis} visualised in figure \ref{fig:yeastPSMs} and the Consensus matrix of the largest ensemble run (i.e. $CC(10001, 1000)$) using the \texttt{maxpear} function from the R package \texttt{mcclust} \cite{fritsch2012mcclust} using default settings except for \texttt{k.max} which was set to 275 (the rounding down of $N/2$). To perform the GO term over-representation analysis we used the \texttt{Bioconductor} packages \texttt{clusterProfiler} \citep{yu2012clusterProfiler}, \texttt{biomaRt} \citep{durinck2009mapping} and the annotation package \texttt{org.Sc.sgd.db} \citep{carlson2014org}.

We conditioned the test on the background set of the 551 yeast genes in the data. The gene labelled YIL167W was not found in the annotation database and was dropped from the analysis leaving a background universe of 550 genes. A hypergeometric test was used to check if the number of genes associated with specific GO terms within a cluster was greater than expected by random chance. We corrected the $p$-values using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction \citep{benjamini1995controlling} and defined significance by a threshold of 0.01. We plotted the over-represented GO terms for the different clusterings within each dataset using the three different ontologies of ``Molecular function" (\textbf{MF}), ``Biological process" (\textbf{BP}) and ``Cellular component" (\textbf{CC}) (figures \ref{fig:yeastGOMF}, \ref{fig:yeastGOBP} and \ref{fig:yeastGOCC} respectively). 

We find that the Consensus clustering finds terms common to all of the long chains. It also finds some terms with low $p$-values common to a majority of chains (such as DNA helicase activity in the MF ontology for the Timecourse dataset) and a small number of GO terms unique to itself. These terms that no long chain find are normally related to other terms already over-represented within either the Consensus clustering or a number of the long chains. For example, the transmembrane transporter activity and transporter activity terms uncovered by the ensemble in the Timecourse dataset are related to terms found across 3 of the chains and by Consensus clustering (specifically transferase activity and phosphotransferase). 
%We believe that the clustering provided by Consensus clustering of MDI results in a meaningful clustering that can uncover


Furthermore, we also note that the Bayesian chains have very significant disagreements between eachother; there is no consensus on the results with many terms enriched in one or two chains (see the behaviour in any ontology for the ChIP-chip and PPI datasets). We argue that the final partition from Consensus clustering is more consistent than any of the individual long chains, agreeing where the chains agree and providing sensible differences to any given chain. As the chains are not converged and there is no clear overlap, a full analysis would be difficult to defend using any one of these long chains. 

ASIDE: I THINK I NEED A STATEMENT LIKE THIS, BUT FEEL IT IS A LITTLE HEAVY-HANDED

We believe that Consensus clustering does offer a solution to problems preventing the use of complex models such as MDI in their currently implemented forms, finding meaningful structure in a reproducible analysis.

%PPI MF GO:
%There is much disagreement between the Bayesian chains; more so in this case with no terms found in all 5 chains. This is the dataset with the most disagreement between chains in the PSMs (as seen in figure \ref{fig:yeastPSMs}).
%
%ChIP-chip MF GO:
%there is more consistency across chains, but there is still significant disagreement. The Consensus clustering finds largely terms that are common to several chains. Some terms are unique to the Consensus clustering, for example \emph{DNA binding} and \emph{nucleic acid binding} emerge in the Consensus clustering but no Bayesian chain, but this terms have overlap in their associated genes and thus evidence for one suggests the other. Furthermore, 3 clusters in chain 10 from the Bayesian analysis does have terms associated with binding over-represented in three clusters and chains 3 and 5 have many different types of binding emerging. Thus the binding terms found by the Consensus clustering are partially supported in the long chains. The other two terms unique to Consensus clustering, transmembrane transporter activity and transporter activity, are both related to each other. Transferase activity and phosphotransferase, two terms found by both Consensus clustering and three of the Bayesian chains, are associated with transporting molecules within the cell and across the cell membrane. Thus the emergence of additional terms associated with transportation are not surprising, particularly as those unique to Consensus clustering have small $p$-values.

Many terms are found only in a subset of chains.
